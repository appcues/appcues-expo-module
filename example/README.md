# Appcues Expo Module Example App

This is a bare bones Expo app to test integration with the Appcues Expo Module.

## üöÄ Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies for the module. Only necessary because this is referenced locally by the example app.
npm install

# Install dependencies for the example app.
cd ./example
npm install

# Generate the native projects
npx expo prebuild --clean

# Run the app for Android
npx expo run:android

# Run the app for iOS
npx expo run:ios
```

## üìù Notes

The config plugin is called from `app.json`. It uses a local path (`"../app.plugin.js"`) to enable testing. `@appcues/expo-config` should be used otherwise.

Do not modify `/ios` and `/android` directly. These are generated by `expo prebuild` and would not be available for editing in an EAS managed workflow app.
